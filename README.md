# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

## Overview
This project is a fun implementation of the classic "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game that uses your webcam to allow you to play against the computer in real-time. The program detects hand gestures via the camera and determines whether you chose rock, paper, or scissors, and then plays against the computer's random choice.

## Features
- **Real-time hand gesture recognition**: Uses your webcam to detect your hand gesture.
- **Play against the computer**: The computer randomly selects rock, paper, or scissors to compete against your choice.
- **Simple and intuitive**: Easy to play with a straightforward interface.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: ```git clone git@github.com:Sinaatkd/Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game.git```
2. Navigate to project foledr ```cd Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game```
3. Install required packages ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
4. Run the script ```python/python3 main.py```

## How It Works
The game uses computer vision techniques to detect the shape of your hand and identify whether you're showing rock, paper, or scissors.
The computer makes a random choice, and the game determines the winner based on standard rock-paper-scissors rules.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The core programming language.
- **OpenCV**: For accessing and processing video input.
- **MediaPipe**: For real-time hand gesture recognition.
